My first ML project created for Course Work in university

During this project I tried to create "Virtual Flow Meter"

Goal: build ML model for oil/water/gas production calculation based on operating parameters (pressure, temperature etc.) of natural flow well.

Data was collected from open sources, oil field "Kyle". More on that:
